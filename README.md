    -> "Youtuba Channels" are the libraries for Subscribers, you can watch the channels whenever and whatever channels you would like to watch 

# What is CDN?
* Content Delivery Network(CDN) is a network of interconnected servers.
* It will speed up webpage loading for data-heavy applications

# Why do we use CDN?
* When a user visits a website, data from that website's server has to travel across the internet to reach the user's computer. If the user is located far from that server, it will take a long time to load a large file, such as a video or website image. Instead, the website content is stored on CDN servers geographically closer to the users and reaches their computers much faster
